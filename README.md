Group project for DSC106 project 3

Write-up:

We chose a line plot as the foundation of our visualization because it effectively illustrates how mice activity and temperature differ by gender over time under various filters. Drawing inspiration from lab exercises and class materials, we incorporated dropdown menus for data type (activity or temperature) and gender (male or female), allowing users to filter the displayed information easily. Additionally, we added tooltips to provide detailed information about specific mice when hovering over the graph. A variance score which is the sum of squared difference between male and female mice represents the activity level or temperature difference of two mice. While we considered using a dual y-axis chart—with temperature on one axis and activity level on the other—we ultimately opted for a simpler design. This approach prioritizes clarity, enabling viewers to quickly grasp key insights without being overwhelmed by excessive information.

We want the viewers to be able to select what they are interested in themselves, so we decided to create an interactive graph that grants viewers max flexibility. Through the design of drop down menus, viewers are able to compare between females and males mice overall or individually. Also, viewers are able to choose day time only or night time only to see the difference in gender under different times of the day. Also, we highlighted the estrus period so that it further help viewers to see if estrus affect the statistics of female mice compared to male mice. 

Each team member met multiple times, either in person or virtually through Zoom, over the past few weeks. Jiaxin Yang and Zeyu Qi focused more on visualization, design, and communicating with tutors for revisions, while Junshu Xin and Borui Lin worked on more coding and bug-fixing. Overall, everyone contributed equally to the project.

As a team, we collectively discussed the work of the next steps and voluntarily divided tasks, such as code fixing or designing visualization logic. All members participated in coding and providing suggestions. At the end of the meetings, we typically chose the version with the most contributions as the final one and updated the project.

Each member spent approximately 5 to 6 hours on the project, including topic discussions, coding, bug fixing, and summarizing our work and plan for the next collaboration. The most time-consuming part was revising the overall direction of the project. After discussing it with our tutor, we realized that our project lacked exploratory behaviors for readers. We made significant revisions to improve the exploratory experience, making it more interesting and interactive for readers.
